## What is the project
The  project is a PST booking system (PST stands for Parent Student Teacher Confrenses). Which will be able to be accessed by both teachers and parents. The software will have two different ui's based of the username inputed. If the user is a teacher it will take them to a screen to see all of their bookings which includes the times they are at and for what subject so a teacher can better organise themself prior to the meeting. On the other hand if the user is a parent then it takes them to a screen to book what teacher and what time appointment they would like.
